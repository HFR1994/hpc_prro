== Concluding Remarks

  The Raven Roosting Optimization algorithm demostratres a good tendency to be a good candidate for parallelizarion. While MPI parallelization yielded expected results based on the computational workload. However, OpenMP research could be caracterized as unconclusive, some results had erratical behavoir that could be an invitation for further investigation. 
  
  However the purpose of the project was implemented, I sucessfully implemented a algorithm and saw how the parrallel computing in a HPC scenario does have drastic effects of execution times. Further analysis to this proyect can be done by implementing alternative pieces of code such a different objective functions are parallelization techniques such as Island or Master slave configurations that could affect the results of the experiment.
  
  This project prove to be a nice introduction to the topic and I would personally like to keep researching other techniques and implementations.
