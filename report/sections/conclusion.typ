== Concluding Remarks

  The Raven Roosting Optimization algorithm demonstrates a good tendency to be a strong candidate for parallelization. MPI parallelization yielded expected results based on the computational workload. However, OpenMP research could be characterized as unconclusive, as some results had erratic behavior that could be an invitation for further investigation.

  However, the purpose of the project was achieved—I successfully implemented an algorithm and observed how parallel computing in an HPC scenario does have drastic effects on execution times. Further analysis of this project can be done by implementing alternative pieces of code such as different objective functions or parallelization techniques such as Island or Master-Slave configurations that could affect the results of the experiment.

  This project proved to be a nice introduction to the topic and I would personally like to keep researching other techniques and implementations.
